<h3>More about Me...</h3>
<h4>2022 Target Goals:</h4>
<p>My real big goal this year is to get my <abbr title="The Computer Technology Industry Association">Comptia</abbr> A+ certification.
  I recently started studying for this certification as a basis for multiple different industry certification I plan on trying to
  pass before graduating in 2023. Another big focus for me this year is narrowing down my focus area for my degree.
</p>

<h4>Interesting Fact</h4>
<p>I am not super interesting. Before attending ASU, I studying filmmaking at two other Arizona school with an emphasis on screenwriting.
Once in the third grade I went to Washington D.C. for a family trip. Before going my teacher told me to write a letter to a Arizona
Senator in hopes that they might give me passes to the Capitol Building. After writing Jon Kyle (or at least his office),
I was sent two passes and was able to tour and meet Sentor Kyle when I visited. I am also double jointed in both thumbs.
