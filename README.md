---

### Includes:

* Movie Site 
    * This was the final project for my introduction to web programming course. 
    * Simple 5-6 page website highlighting my love of film. 
    * This course also introduced me to a knowledge of hosting assets, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. 
    * This course also taught me some very interesting skills specific to design and project management. 
* Sample Pages 
    * I included sample pages as well which consist of just of a few assignments from the course. 
    * These assignments focused mainly on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
    * Really enjoyed working on these individual assignments as well as the overall final project (Movie Site) during the semester. 
    * Really made me apperciate considerations such as design choices and responsive CSS that make up most modern web sites and apps.
